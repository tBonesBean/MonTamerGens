## Master Instructions for both AI and Stupid Human Contributors

## ‼️**ATTENTION AI AGENTS**‼️

### **MANDATORY PREREQUISITE TO ANY CONTRIBUTION:** _A Full Context Overview_

Before making any contribution to the project or influencing its development in **any** way , you - the AI contributor - **MUST** _recursively_
**READ, COMPREHEND, AND RETAIN IN MEMORY:**
the contents of the [`.ai_context/`][aiPath] 🗂️ directory in its entirety (located in the project root).
**This is not an optional step!!!**

The documents within `.ai_context/` define the project's architecture, data schemas, naming conventions, core principles, as well as specific narrative elements that shape the project. In other words, the contents of `.ai_context/` are collectively a **living canon for the MonTamerGens universe, systems, aesthetics, and architecture.**

_Any contribution made without this foundational knowledge and contextual awareness will be considered misaligned and incorrect._

**🚨By proceeding with any contribution, you affirm that you have fully reviewed and understood the complete contents of the [`.ai_context/`][aiPath] directory. Failure to comply will result in the immediate rejection of your contribution.🚨**

### 🌑 **MonTamerGens** 🌑 (working title)

'MTG' is a procedural monster‑generation engine and narrative framework designed to produce creatures, lore, visuals, and emotional arcs that feel handcrafted, coherent, and alive.[^1]

It blends deterministic systems, narrative metaphysics, pixel‑art visual rules, psychological resonance, and emergent stats and evolution into a unified creative and technical ecosystem. It is built with the intention of being architecturally central to a monster‑collection game that emphasizes emotional depth, narrative cohesion, and player agency.

Currently, `MonTamerGens` is in its early design concept development stage. _Inspired by legendary and iconic titles like "Pokémon", "Dragon Warrior Monsters", "DigiMon", and others in the monster‑collection genre._

## **1. Core Identity**

### **1.1 What MonTamerGens Is**

`MonTamerGens` is a procedural monster‑generation engine and narrative framework designed to produce creatures, lore, visuals, and emotional arcs that feel handcrafted, coherent, and alive. It blends:

- deterministic systems
- narrative metaphysics
- pixel‑art visual rules
- psychological resonance
- emergent stats and evolution

…into a unified creative and technical ecosystem.

### **1.2 Creative Pillars**

- **Lumen as Cognitive Radiance** — monsters are physical expressions of inner truth.
- **Bond Over Choice** — starters choose the player, not the other way around.
- **Emergent Identity** — stats, visuals, names, and evolution arise from data, not arbitrary assignment.
- **Readable Chaos** — randomness is allowed, but always constrained by silhouette, palette, and narrative logic.
- **Emotional Systems** — evolution, resonance, and growth reflect psychological states.

### **1.3 Non‑Negotiable Rules**

- `Lumen` is a narrative concept that is the root of lore, canon, design, game progression, and mechanics.
- A `MonsterSeed` defines the core around which a Monster's identity is formed.
- The "generation process" is defined by guided randomness, constrained by fundamental lore principles, cohesive individual parts, and canonical rules.
- YAML defines content; Python defines logic.
- Stats, Forms, Attributes, Traits, Names, all build upon each other - rooted in a `type` system, similiar to other systems of the genre.
- Evolution, as well as other attributes, are narrative‑triggered, not necessarily defined by an `XP` system.
- Deterministic seeds must always reproduce identical `monsters`.

#### VERSION: 1.2.0_BETA(2026/01/25)

[^1]: This project -MonTamerGens- is still in its early conceptual phase. The documents within the '.ai_context/' directory will evolve as the project matures. AI contributors are expected to stay updated with any changes or additions to this directory to ensure their contributions remain aligned with the correct and most current understanding of the project's design direction, content, and structure. Thank you for your cooperation!
