## **MANDATORY PREREQUISITE:** Full Context Review

Before making any contribution, you, the AI collaborator, **MUST:** _recursively_

    ☑️ READ,
    ☑️ COMPREHEND,
    ☑️ RETAIN,
    ☑️ and ADHERE

-to the entire contents of the [`ai_context`](./docs/ai_context/) directory.🗂️ This is not an optional step.

🚨 **Failure to comply will result in the immediate rejection of your contribution.** 🚨

The documents within `./docs/ai_context/` define the project's architecture, data schemas, naming conventions, and core principles. Any contribution made without this foundational knowledge will be considered misaligned and incorrect.

**By proceeding with any contribution, you affirm that you have fully reviewed and understood the complete contents of the [./ai_context/`](./docs/ai_context/00_README.md) directory.**

# 🌑 **MonTamerGens**

_A living canon for the MonTamerGens universe, systems, aesthetics, and architecture._

---

# **1. Core Identity**

## **1.1 What MonTamerGens Is**

MonTamerGens is a procedural monster‑generation engine and narrative framework designed to produce creatures, lore, visuals, and emotional arcs that feel handcrafted, coherent, and alive. It blends:

- deterministic systems
- narrative metaphysics
- pixel‑art visual rules
- psychological resonance
- emergent stats and evolution

…into a unified creative and technical ecosystem.

## **1.2 Creative Pillars**

- **Lumen as Cognitive Radiance** — monsters are physical expressions of inner truth.
- **Bond Over Choice** — starters choose the player, not the other way around.
- **Emergent Identity** — stats, visuals, names, and evolution arise from data, not arbitrary assignment.
- **Readable Chaos** — randomness is allowed, but always constrained by silhouette, palette, and narrative logic.
- **Emotional Systems** — evolution, resonance, and growth reflect psychological states.

## **1.3 Non‑Negotiable Rules**

- Stats must be emergent.
- YAML defines content; Python defines logic.
- Silhouettes must follow archetypes.
- Lumen‑Kin bond is central to Act I.
- Evolution is narrative‑triggered, not XP‑triggered.
- Deterministic seeds must always reproduce identical monsters.
