## **PRIMARY CLUSTERS IDEA....** _already partially implemented, but I'm tempted to address it differently_

- _*CURRENT PRIMARIES*_

- type: Axiom
- type: Azimuth
- type: Bastion
- type: Bloom
- type: Echo
- type: Flow
- type: Geist
- type: Idol
- type: Mire
- type: Nadir
- type: Oracle
- type: Rift
- type: Spur
- type: Vessel
- type: Zenith
- type: Fracture

## **BIT OF EXISTING SYSTEM STRUCTURE** _just thinking through it as it stands..._

### 1. STRUCTURAL — _Limits, Constraint, Load_

Defines what **cannot be exceeded, escaped, or ignored**.

- **Axiom** — Law, rule, inevitability
- **Bastion** — Endurance, defense, refusal to yield
- **Vessel** — Capacity, containment, unrealized potential
- **Nadir** — Terminal collapse, lowest bound

_Cluster flavor:_ Heavy, static, oppressive. Lumen here resists change.

### 2. VECTOR — _Motion, Direction, Disruption_

Defines **how reality moves**, not where it ends.

- **Spur** — Impulse, acceleration magnitude
- **Flow** — Adaptation, redirection, continuity
- **Rift** — Discontinuity, paradox, rupture
- **Azimuth** — Orientation, bearing, vector without destination

_Cluster flavor:_ Migration, shifting terrain, movement‑triggered evolution.

### 3. RESIDUAL — _Aftermath, Persistence, Decay_

Defines what **remains after an event**.

- **Echo** — Memory, recurrence, resonance
- **Geist** — Absence, liminality, threshold states
- **Mire** — Decay, stagnation, suffocation
- **Fracture** — Structural strain, latent failure, pre‑collapse instability

_Cluster flavor:_ Repetition, haunting, corruption, instability without spectacle.

### 4. EXPRESSIVE — _Meaning, Projection, Culmination_

Defines **how significance is interpreted or realized**.

- **Bloom** — Growth, vitality, renewal
- **Idol** — Belief, projection, attention
- **Oracle** — Pattern perception, foresight without certainty
- **Zenith** — Culmination, apex, realization

_Cluster flavor:_ Attention‑drawing, narrative bias, belief‑driven outcomes.

## IDEA for Secondary Types

- Primary and Secondary type isolation.
  primary != `seed.secondary_type`
  secondary != `seed.primary_type`

- Type Clusters, same structure as primary type system, with altered and added content:
    1.  🧭 Positional / Structural Modifiers
        _Where something sits in a system_

    2.  ⚙️ Dynamic / Energetic Modifiers
        _How energy, change, or motion expresses_

    3.  🧠 Role / Capability / Identity Modifiers
        _How competent, trained, or shaped something is_

    4.  🧪 State / Reactivity Modifiers
        _How something responds or changes in different conditions_

    5.  🌌 Abstract / Exotic Modifiers
        _How something exists outside normal parameters_

    6.  🔮 Contrarian / Circumvental Modifiers
        _How something reacts oppositionally when boundary conditions or restraints are introduced_

    7.  👑 Power / Authority Modifiers
        _Social or metaphysical dominance_

    8.  ☠️ Moral / Transgressive Modifiers
        _Ethical alignment or taboo-breaking tendencies. How the world judges this behavior_

### Potential secondaries without trying to fit them into clusters yet:

- type: Locus[\*](#a)
- type: Shear
- type: Impostor/Impose[\*](#a)
- type: Catalyst[\*](#a)
- type: Nexus
- type: Paragon[\*\*](#b)
- type: Profane
- type: Adept
- type: Inert[\*](#a)
- type: Pulse[\*](#a)
- type: Excess[\*](#a)
- type: Surge
- type: Hegemon[\*\*](#b)
- type: Drift[\*](#a)
- type: Veil
- type: Pious
- type: Flux
- type: Phase[\*](#a)
- type: Sensor
- type: Emissar/Emissary
- type: Ordain[\*\*](#b)
- type: Phenomena[\*](#a)
- type: Convert
- type: Heretic
- type: Rogue[\*](#a)
- type: Zealot
- type: Cyclic
- type: Convalesce
- type: Paradox
- type: Aquiescent
- type: Contrary
- type: Zeitgeist[\*](#a)
- type: Inverse
- ... I'm sure there are more, but I have to force myself to move on for now. Dex will help me tighten up the terminology and linguistic structure.
  <br><br>

<a id="a">\* </a>feel less impactful, not sure of the fit.
<a id="b">\*\* </a>very likely a strong primary type instead of secondary, may review primaries and consider possible substitutions.

### Weak/Replaceable Primary Types - Consider replacing with stronger types noted above

- type: Flow
- type: Geist
- type: Azimuth
- type: Bastion
  ... possibly others. Gotta consult with my boy Dexter on this one.

## AFTER DELIBERATION: DECIDED TO TRY FORCE MAPPING TO CLUSTERS (purely for my own mental clarity, NOT intended to be the actual implementation)

**Mental Excersise:** _force every type into one of these 10 distinct clusters/buckets - Hopefully will allow me to stress-test the type and cluster definitions/cohesiveness/canonical relevance/etc. It should reveal which concepts are truly distinct lore elevators, and which are just synonyms for existing contexts._

### 1. 🗺️ Positional / Structural

_Where things sit. The architecture of reality._

- **Nadir** (The lowest point)
- **Zenith** (The highest point)
- **Locus** (The specific point of focus)
- **Nexus** (The connection point/hub)

### 2. 🧭 Dynamic / Energetic

_How things move. The physics of reality._

- **Spur** (Sudden, sharp acceleration)
- **Pulse** (Rhythmic emission)
- **Flux** (Constant, chaotic change)
- **Drift** (Aimless motion)
- **Shear** (Tearing motion)

### 3. 💯 Expressive / Actualize

_How the inevitability of change is projected. The outcome of reality._

- **Oracle** (The speaker or vehicle of the immenent)
- **Phenomena** (The inexplicable, unbelievable - yet witnessed)
- **Zeitgeist** (The spirit of the times/moment)

### 4. 👤 Residual / Remnant

_What remains. The shadow of reality._

- **Echo** (The repeating sound/memory)
- **Scar** (The lasting mark of trauma)
- **Akasha** (The eternal record)
- **Revenant** (The returning entity)
- **Vestige** (The remaining trace/sign)

### 5. 🌌 Abstract / Exotic

_What is outside. The metaphysical edge._

- **Ethereal** (The spirit/non-matter)
- **Vessel** (Vehicle for potential)
- **Void** (Absence manifested)
- **Veil** (The barrier between truths)

### 6. 👑 Power / Authority

_Who is in charge. The hierarchy._

- **Hegemon** (The supreme leader)
- **Paragon** (The perfect example/standard)
- **Ordained** (The chosen one)
- **Emissar** (The voice of authority)
- **Paradox** (The impossibility)

### 7. 🔮 Societal / Ethos

_How consequence is justified and reacted to. Friction within order._

- **Axiom** (The foundational rule)
- **Civitas** (The collective will)
- **Dogma** (Collective perception)
- **Empyreal** (The one who enforces the rule)
- **Petulant** (The one who resists the rule)

### 8. ☠️ Moral / Transgressive

_When one is bound by singular devotion - be it to morality, or chaos. Such a bond can't exclude inevitable consequences._

- **Profane** (Desecrating the holy)
- **Pious** (Adhering to the holy)
- **Heretic** (Rejecting the doctrine)
- **Pilgrim** (Ever faithful wanderer)
- **Zealot** (Fanatical extremism in practice)
- **Convert** (Changing sides)
- **Idolatrous** (Facilitates the practicing of devotion, physical anchor for metaphysical)

### 9. 🧠 Role / Capability / Identity

_What something does. The job._

- **Adept** (Skilled user)
- **Sensor** (Detector)

### 10. 🧪 State / Reactivity

_How something feels/reacts. The condition._

- **Inert** (Spent potential)
- **Catalyst** (Enabler of others)

### ? Growith / Increase

_How something changes over time - especially as it pertains to growth vs decay. A position on a spectrum of increase/decrease_

- **Mire** (The stagnation/decay)
- **Flourish** (Consistent growth / typically favorable circumstances)
- **Burgeon** (From nothing, it can spring forth)

### ?

---

- **Surfeit** (State of excess/abundance)
- **Dearth** (State of desperation/lacking)
- **Convalesce** (Healing state)
- **Aquiesce** (Yielding state)

## 🔍 Self-Analysis of the Mapping Mental Excersise:

### **1. The "God Cluster" (Power & Moral)**

The mega 'dense' lore vibe from the types in **Power** and **Moral** (Hegemon, Paragon, Heretic, Zealot, Emissar, Ordained) is palpable...

- _Observation:_ This makes me think that maybe the deepest levels of lore can be foundationally centered on _divinity, hierarchy, and social order_.
- _Now Apparent:_ These feel like **factions** or **alignments** rather than types. **Orders** to be attained after conditions are fulfilled. Possibly through rigorous trials meant to prove worthiness. The mental model I keep coming back to when trying to define this is: - However a Mon ends up attaining these 'alignments', I've not considered yet. But gaining these 'Orders' are what makes an already rare Machamp Pokemon Card, a fucking **HOLOGRAPHIC** Machamp Pokemon Card. :) they aren't types. Not at all. Too strong and too rich to come as a built-in, "accessories included", Toys'R'Us shopping spree, Monster feature.

### **2. The "Physics Cluster" (Dynamic & Structural)**

- _Observation:_ These are clean, physics-based metaphors. They work best as the abstract types foundation because they describe _how the monster exists in space-time_.

### **3. The "Adjective Cluster" (State & Role)**

- _Observation:_ These now seem to be perfect for future systems that have the potential to achieve a sort of _resolve_ or _absolution_. Triggering a form of progression, or elevation.

### **4. The "Mystery Cluster" (Abstract & Residual)**

- _Observation:_ These are great for evoking a sense of wonder, the unknown, and the metaphysical. They work well to describe _the unseen forces_ that shape the monster's existence.
- _Now Apparent:_ These types could be used to describe _hidden attributes_ or _latent abilities_ that are not immediately visible but influence the monster's behavior and interactions.

---

#### **CHECKPOINT** A lot to consider, but I really think this could be massively beneficial to lore, canonical aspects, narrative potential, future systems (breeding, evolution, event triggers...)
