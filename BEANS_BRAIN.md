## Secondary Types

- Primary and Secondary type isolation.
  primary != `seed.secondary_type`
  secondary != `seed.primary_type`

- Type Clusters, same structure as primary type system
    1.  🧭 Positional / Structural Modifiers
        _Where something sits in a system_

    2.  ⚙️ Dynamic / Energetic Modifiers
        _How energy, change, or motion expresses_

    3.  🧠 Role / Capability / Identity Modifiers
        _How competent, trained, or shaped something is_

    4.  🧪 State / Reactivity Modifiers
        _How something responds or changes in different conditions_

    5.  🌌 Abstract / Exotic Modifiers
        _How something exists outside normal parameters_

    6.  🔮 Contrarian / Circumvental Modifiers
        _How something reacts oppositionally when boundary conditions or restraints are introduced_

### Potential secondaries without trying to fit them into clusters yet:

- type: Locus[\*](#a)
- type: Shear
- type: Impostor/Impose[\*](#a)
- type: Catalyst[\*](#a)
- type: Nexus
- type: Paragon[\*\*](#b)
- type: Profane
- type: Adept
- type: Inert[\*](#a)
- type: Pulse[\*](#a)
- type: Excess[\*](#a)
- type: Surge
- type: Hegemon[\*\*](#b)
- type: Drift[\*](#a)
- type: Veil
- type: Pious
- type: Flux
- type: Phase[\*](#a)
- type: Sensor
- type: Emissar/Emissary
- type: Ordain[\*\*](#b)
- type: Phenomena[\*](#a)
- type: Convert
- type: Heretic
- type: Rogue[\*](#a)
- type: Zealot
- type: Cyclic
- type: Revert[\*](#a)
- ... I'm sure there are more, but I have to force myself to move on for now.
  <br><br>

<a id="a">\* </a>feel less impactful, not sure of the fit.
<a id="b">\*\* </a>very likely a strong primary type instead of secondary, may review primaries and consider possible substitutions.

### Weak/Replaceable Primary Types - Consider replacing with stronger types noted above

- type: Flow
- type: Geist
- type: Azimuth
- type: Bastion
  ... possibly others. Gotta consult with my boy Dexter on this one.
