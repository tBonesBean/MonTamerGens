# Appendix C: Expanded Type Glossary

This document defines the **deep semantic meaning** of each core Type in MonTamerGens.

Types are **not elements** and **not species**. They are _ontological forces_ — patterns of behavior, cognition, and manifestation that shape monsters at every layer: stats, form, naming, mutagens, narrative hooks, and visual language.

Use this glossary as:

-   a reference for **name generation** (prefixes, suffixes, roots)
-   guidance for **mutagen compatibility**
-   constraints for **Dex entry tone**
-   alignment checks for future systems (evolution, resonance, emotion)

**3. RESIDUAL** (Aftermath, Persistence, Decay)
