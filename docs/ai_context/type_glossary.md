# MonTamerGens Type Glossary (Canonical)

This document defines the **deep semantic meaning** of each core Type in MonTamerGens.

Types are **not elements** and **not species**. They are _ontological forces_ — patterns of behavior, cognition, and manifestation that shape monsters at every layer: stats, form, naming, mutagens, narrative hooks, and visual language.

Use this glossary as:

- a reference for **name generation** (prefixes, suffixes, roots)
- guidance for **mutagen compatibility**
- constraints for **Dex entry tone**
- alignment checks for future systems (evolution, resonance, emotion)

# IMMEDIATE CHANGES TO BE MADE!!!!

_REVISE DOCUMENT TO REFLECT 4 DISTINCT TYPE CLUSTERS and CORRESPONDING TYPES_
_(NOW 16 TOTAL PRIMARY TYPES)_

- 4 Distinct Type Clusters (Non-mechanical, Canonical):
    - 4 Types in Each Cluster

                  1.  **Structural**Commonality:
                  	- Axiom
                  	- Bastion
                  	- Vessel
                  	- Nadir

              		Commonality:
              		These types define limits — what cannot be exceeded, escaped, or ignored.

              		Interference idea:
              			Lumen in this cluster resists change.
              			World events might feel heavy, static, or oppressive when these types co-locate.


                  2.  **Vector**
                  	- Spur
                  	- Flow
                  	- Rift
                  	- Azimuth

              		Commonality:
              		These types define motion, not results.

              		Interference idea:
              		When multiple of these coexist:
              		- paths open and close
              		- terrain shifts
              		- monsters migrate
              		- evolution triggers via movement, not combat


                  3.  **Residual**
                  	- Echo
                  	- Mire
                  	- Geist
                  	- Fracture

              		Commonality:
              		These types define aftermath — the world after something happened.

              		Interference idea:
              		Zones dominated by this cluster could:
              		- repeat encounters
              		- spawn variants
              		- blur time or identity
              		- alter naming / Dex tone automatically


                  4.  **Expressive**
                  	- Zenith
                  	- Oracle
                  	- Idol
                  	- Bloom


              		Commonality:
              		These types define interpretation — not mechanics, but meaning.

              		Interference idea:
              		High concentrations could:
              		- attract attention
              		- trigger cult behavior
              		- bias narrative outcomes
              		- alter player choice framing
