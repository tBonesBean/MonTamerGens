# **00_README.md — IntelliHub Entry Point**

_Your anchor for navigating MonTamerGens’ architecture, lore, and design._

---

## 🧭 Purpose of This Directory

This folder (`/ai_context/`) contains the **IntelliHub** — a curated set of documents that define:

- the system architecture
- the creative canon
- the data contracts
- the naming rules
- the responsibilities of each module
- the metaphysical lore
- the visual and narrative design pillars

It is designed to be:

- readable by humans
- parseable by AI agents
- trustworthy for future collaborators
- extensible as the project evolves

## 🧠 How to Use This Hub

- Start with **design_bible.md** and **lore_core.md** to understand the world.
- Read **architecture_overview.md** to understand the engine.
- Use **module_purposes/** to trace specific modules.
- Use **schemas/** to validate data shapes.
- Use **appendices/** for quick reference and navigation.

This hub is your **source of truth**.  
If something isn’t documented here, it isn’t canonical yet.
