# Monster Type System -- Architectural Breakthrough Summary

## Core Philosophical Foundation

The system separates identity from behavior.

- **Primary** = Existential Identity (what a monster *is*)

- **Secondary** = Behavioral Negotiation (how that identity interacts
    with change)
- **Stats** = Potential energy landscape (capacity, not destiny)

This separation is the central innovation of the system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Identity Stack, or "BioMatrix" - (Four Layers)

A monster is always generated with 4 properties describing more than simply a way to categorize it.
These four types - collectively to be known as its *BioMatrix* - define its identity,
determine the possible forms (or silhouettes), a unique 'rarity' value that will further influence the generation process, and much more.

*The type system now operates on the following four levels:*

### 1. Primary Cluster

Defines macro stat curvature. - General distribution envelope - Growth
elasticity - Structural silhouette - No stat is implicitly dominant

Primary Clusters define the *shape tendency* of identity.

### 2. Primary Type

Defines centroid shift within cluster curvature. - Eases troughs -
Enhances peaks - Creates bias tension - Establishes developmental
leverage points

Primary Type does NOT assign a fixed role. It creates fertile ground for
specialization.

### 3. Secondary Cluster

Defines behavioral negotiation grammar in conflict. Locked triad: -
Impetus (propagation / escalation) - Veil (distortion / redirection) -
Holdfast (persistence / resistance)

Secondary Clusters govern how pressure resolves when Primary identities
interact.

### 4. Secondary Type

Fine-tunes modulation style within that behavioral grammar. This layer
influences tactical nuance, not identity essence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Combat Resolution Philosophy

Interactions resolve as:

Attacker Primary → Defender Secondary\
Defender Primary → Attacker Secondary

Not Primary vs Primary.

This preserves ontological integrity and emphasizes behavioral
negotiation over elemental counters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stat Philosophy

Stats represent **potential energy**, not final form.

When a player views a stat spread, the intended reaction is:

> "I wonder what I could develop this into."

Not: - "I understand its fixed role." - "This is clearly a tank."

This requires: - Nonlinear scaling - Cross-stat synergies - Behavioral
modulation from secondary types - Ability-based amplification paths

Monsters are signal profiles, not archetypes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Waveform Model (Conceptual Framework)

Every monster can be conceptualized as a composite waveform:

- Primary Cluster = Macro curvature class
- Primary Type = Centroid emphasis
- Secondary Cluster = Modulation style
- Secondary Type = Fine modulation
- Individual variation = Amplitude noise

The system intentionally limits decomposition to two fundamental
identity components: Primary and Secondary.

Development modifies phase and interference --- not frequency identity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Developmental Evolution (Non-Permanent but Transformative)

Instead of permanent stat inflation, development operates as:

## Phase Shifts

Experiential events modify: - Interaction thresholds - Conversion
rules - Harmonic interference patterns - Expression pathways

But NOT: - Primary identity - Secondary cluster grammar - Ontological
classification

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Kin Wounds

Kin Wounds introduce distortion into the waveform: - Suppressed
amplitudes - Instability in resolution behavior - Altered negotiation
outcomes

They do not reduce identity --- they alter expression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lumen Embracing

Lumen Embracing realigns harmonics: - Restores suppressed amplitudes -
Unlocks alternate behavioral interactions - Modifies how existing stats
convert into outcomes

This is identity affirmation, not stat buffing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guardrails (System Integrity Rules)

The following must remain invariant:

1. Primary defines existential identity.
2. Secondary defines negotiation behavior.
3. No tertiary hidden identity layer may emerge.
4. Development modifies interference, not essence.
5. Secondary never overrides Primary ontology.
6. Stats represent potential, not destiny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Intent

Every monster must be: - Viable - Developable - Expressive -
Non-industrial

The system rejects: - Filler creatures - Fixed archetype buckets -
Linear stat destiny

Instead, it supports: - Player-driven developmental direction -
Narrative-mechanical integration - Emergent specialization - Build
diversity rooted in identity integrity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Core Principle

Monsters are not roles.

They are identities with potential energy, modulated through behavioral
philosophy, and shaped through lived experience.
