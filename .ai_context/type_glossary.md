# MonTamerGens Type Glossary (Canonical)

This document defines the **deep semantic meaning** of each canonical Primary Type in MonTamerGens.

Types are **not elements** and **not species**. They are _ontological forces_ -- patterns of behavior, cognition, and manifestation that shape monsters at every layer: stats, form, naming, mutagens, narrative hooks, and visual language.

Use this glossary as:

- a reference for **name generation** (prefixes, suffixes, roots)
- guidance for **mutagen compatibility**
- constraints for **Dex entry tone**
- alignment checks for future systems (evolution, resonance, emotion)

> **Data source:** `primary_types.yaml` defines the canonical type set.
> **Governing authority:** `type_system_architecture.md` defines the architectural context.

## STRUCTURAL Cluster

_Where things sit. Bounds, load, inevitability._

## Historical / Deprecated Appendix

---

### Deprecated Structural Proposal: 16-Type / 4-Per-Cluster Expansion

The following proposal was explored but **not adopted**. It proposed renaming two clusters (DYNAMIC --> Vector, POTENTIAL --> Expressive) and expanding from 12 to 16 Primary Types (4 per cluster). The canonical structure remains 12 types across 4 clusters as defined in `primary_types.yaml`.

Proposed mapping (for historical reference only):

1. **Structural:** Axiom, Bastion, Vessel, Nadir
2. **Vector (was DYNAMIC):** Spur, Flow, Rift, Azimuth
3. **Residual:** Echo, Mire, Geist, Fracture
4. **Expressive (was POTENTIAL):** Zenith, Oracle, Idol, Bloom

This proposal included interference ideas per cluster (Lumen resistance for Structural, terrain/migration triggers for Vector, encounter repetition for Residual, narrative bias for Expressive) that may inform future design but are not canonical constraints.
