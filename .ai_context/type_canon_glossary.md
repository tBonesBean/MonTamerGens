# MonTamerGens Type Glossary (Canonical)

This document defines the **deep semantic meaning** of each core Type in MonTamerGens.

Types are **not elements** and **not species**. They are _ontological forces_ — patterns of behavior, cognition, and manifestation that shape monsters at every layer: stats, form, naming, mutagens, narrative hooks, and visual language.

Use this glossary as:

- a reference for **name generation** (prefixes, stems, suffixes, epithets)
- guidance for **mutagen compatibility**
- constraints for **Dex entry tone**
- alignment checks for future systems (evolution, resonance, emotion)

## Canonical Structure: The Four Type Clusters

MonTamerGens primary types are organized into **four non‑mechanical, canonical clusters**. These clusters do not impose hard rules, but describe deep commonalities and natural resonance patterns.

### 1. STRUCTURAL — _Limits, Constraint, Load_

Defines what **cannot be exceeded, escaped, or ignored**.

- **Axiom** — Law, rule, inevitability
- **Bastion** — Endurance, defense, refusal to yield
- **Vessel** — Capacity, containment, unrealized potential
- **Nadir** — Terminal collapse, lowest bound

_Cluster flavor:_ Heavy, static, oppressive. Lumen here resists change.

---

### 2. VECTOR — _Motion, Direction, Disruption_

Defines **how reality moves**, not where it ends.

- **Spur** — Impulse, acceleration magnitude
- **Flow** — Adaptation, redirection, continuity
- **Rift** — Discontinuity, paradox, rupture
- **Azimuth** — Orientation, bearing, vector without destination

_Cluster flavor:_ Migration, shifting terrain, movement‑triggered evolution.

---

### 3. RESIDUAL — _Aftermath, Persistence, Decay_

Defines what **remains after an event**.

- **Echo** — Memory, recurrence, resonance
- **Geist** — Absence, liminality, threshold states
- **Mire** — Decay, stagnation, suffocation
- **Fracture** — Structural strain, latent failure, pre‑collapse instability

_Cluster flavor:_ Repetition, haunting, corruption, instability without spectacle.

---

### 4. EXPRESSIVE — _Meaning, Projection, Culmination_

Defines **how significance is interpreted or realized**.

- **Bloom** — Growth, vitality, renewal
- **Idol** — Belief, projection, attention
- **Oracle** — Pattern perception, foresight without certainty
- **Zenith** — Culmination, apex, realization

_Cluster flavor:_ Attention‑drawing, narrative bias, belief‑driven outcomes.

---

## Individual Type Definitions

### AXIOM — _Order, Law, Structure_

Foundational rules made manifest.

### AZIMUTH — _Orientation, Bearing, Vector_

Committed direction without destination; motion valued for its own sake.

### BASTION — _Endurance, Defense, Immovability_

Refusal to yield; holding the line regardless of cost.

### BLOOM — _Growth, Vitality, Expansion_

Life asserting itself beyond constraint.

### ECHO — _Memory, Recurrence, Resonance_

What persists because it once was.

### FLOW — _Adaptation, Continuity, Response_

Survival through adjustment rather than resistance.

### FRACTURE — _Strain, Fault, Imminent Failure_

Structural instability that has not yet collapsed.

### GEIST — _Absence, Spirit, Threshold_

Defined as much by what is missing as what is present.

### IDOL — _Symbol, Passion, Projection_

Power drawn from belief and attention.

### MIRE — _Decay, Weight, Corruption_

Endurance through rot and stagnation.

### NADIR — _Collapse, Depth, Final Limit_

The terminal low point beyond which nothing descends.

### ORACLE — _Perception, Pattern, Foresight_

Seeing shape before outcome without enforcing it.

### RIFT — _Disruption, Paradox, Instability_

Reality breaking under incompatible truths.

### SPUR — _Impulse, Momentum, Violence of Motion_

Acceleration without hesitation.

### VESSEL — _Capacity, Containment, Becoming_

Defined by what may yet be held.

### ZENITH — _Apex, Culmination, Realization_

Arrival at the highest bound of expression.

**Notes:**

- Primary Types describe _what a being is_, not what it does.
- Concepts such as _Locus, Catalyst, Ward, Impose_ are intentionally excluded and reserved for future **secondary/operator layers**.
