    # STRUCTURAL
    Axiom:
        cluster: STRUCTURAL
        label: 'Order / Law'
        question: 'What rule holds here?'
        tagline: 'Law, rule, inevitability'
        summary: 'Law, rule, inevitability'

                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Axiom sustains through persistence and refusal (Holdfast), can impose structure
                through redirection (Veil), but resists chaotic momentum (Impetus).

    Nadir:
        cluster: STRUCTURAL
        label: 'Collapse / Depth'
        question: 'How far down does this go?'
        tagline: 'Terminal collapse, lowest bound'
        summary: 'Terminal collapse, lowest bound'

                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Nadir endures through sheer inertial weight (Holdfast), can be pushed further
                by escalation (Impetus), but resists redirection -- it only goes down (Veil).

    Zenith:
        cluster: STRUCTURAL
        label: 'Apex / Culmination'
        question: 'What is the ceiling here?'
        tagline: 'Culmination, apex, realized limit'
        summary: 'Culmination, apex, realized limit'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Zenith maintains its peak through redirection and reframing (Veil), can endure
                at altitude (Holdfast), but is destabilized by momentum that demands more (Impetus).

    # DYNAMIC
    Spur:
        cluster: DYNAMIC
        label: 'Impulse / Momentum'
        question: 'What set this in motion?'
        tagline: 'Impulse, sudden acceleration'
        summary: 'Impulse, sudden acceleration'

            secondary_clusters:

                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Spur expresses naturally through forward pressure (Impetus), can be redirected
                into feints (Veil), but chafes against inertia and resistance (Holdfast).

    Flux:
        cluster: DYNAMIC
        label: 'Change / Instability'
        question: 'What is shifting here?'
        tagline: 'Continuous change, instability'
        summary: 'Continuous change, instability'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Flux thrives through constant redirection and distortion (Veil), can ride
                momentum when it shifts direction (Impetus), but collapses when forced to hold
                still (Holdfast).

    Surge:
        cluster: DYNAMIC
        label: 'Escalation / Overflow'
        question: 'When does this break containment?'
        tagline: 'Runaway escalation, overflow'
        summary: 'Runaway escalation, overflow'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [IMPETUS]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Surge compounds through momentum and escalation (Impetus), can be contained
                temporarily by resistance (Holdfast), but is poorly served by subtle redirection
                -- it overwhelms (Veil).

    # POTENTIAL
    Fractal:
        cluster: POTENTIAL
        label: 'Recursion / Pattern'
        question: 'What repeats at every scale?'
        tagline: 'Recursive pattern, scale-invariant possibility'
        summary: 'Recursive pattern, scale-invariant possibility'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Fractal expresses through interference and layered distortion (Veil), can
                stabilize into persistent patterns (Holdfast), but is disrupted by blunt
                forward force (Impetus).

    Vessel:
        cluster: POTENTIAL
        label: 'Capacity / Containment'
        question: 'What could this hold?'
        tagline: 'Capacity, containment, unrealized potential'
        summary: 'Capacity, containment, unrealized potential'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:

                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Vessel maintains itself through preservation and endurance (Holdfast), can
                refract what it contains (Veil), but risks shattering under direct pressure
                (Impetus).

    Oracle:
        cluster: POTENTIAL
        label: 'Foresight / Perception'
        question: 'What pattern is emerging?'
        tagline: 'Pattern perception, foresight without certainty'
        summary: 'Pattern perception, foresight without certainty'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Oracle reads possibility through interference and subtle signals (Veil), can
                anticipate escalation (Impetus), but is least effective when locked into rigid
                persistence (Holdfast).

    # RESIDUAL
    Echo:
        cluster: RESIDUAL
        label: 'Memory / Recurrence'
        question: 'What was here before?'
        tagline: 'Memory, recurrence, resonance'
        summary: 'Memory, recurrence, resonance'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Echo persists through distortion and repetition (Veil), can endure as a fixed
                residue (Holdfast), but is scattered by forward momentum that overwrites the
                past (Impetus).

    Relic:
        cluster: RESIDUAL
        label: 'Artifact / History'
        question: 'What survived?'
        tagline: 'Persisting artifact, history made physical'
        summary: 'Persisting artifact, history made physical'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Relic endures through sheer refusal to erode (Holdfast), may distort through
                accumulated residue (Veil), but is poorly suited to forward escalation that
                demands novelty (Impetus).

    Mire:
        cluster: RESIDUAL
        label: 'Decay / Stagnation'
        question: 'What is rotting here?'
        tagline: 'Stagnation, decay, suffocation'
        summary: 'Stagnation, decay, suffocation'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Mire persists through inertia and accumulated weight (Holdfast), can weaponize
                pressure through slow escalation (Impetus), but is least natural when forced to
                redirect or obscure -- it simply sits (Veil).
