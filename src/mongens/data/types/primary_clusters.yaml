                Structure endures most naturally (Holdfast), can bend outcomes via rules (Veil),
                and resists momentum escalation (Impetus).

    DYNAMIC:
        label: 'Kinetic / Dynamic'
        question: 'How does this move?'
        tagline: 'Momentum, disruption, change'

                favored: [IMPETUS]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Motion expresses through momentum (Impetus), can misdirect or refract (Veil),
                but chafes against inertia and refusal (Holdfast).

    POTENTIAL:
        label: 'Potential / Latent'
        question: 'What could be?'
        tagline: 'Capacity, recursion, foresight'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Potential interacts by reframing and interference (Veil), can pressure forward (Impetus),
                and is least natural when forced into fixed inertia (Holdfast).

    RESIDUAL:
        label: 'Residual / Remnant'
        question: 'What remains?'
        tagline: 'Persistence, decay, aftermath'
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Remnants persist and resist erasure (Holdfast), may distort through residue or echo (Veil),
                and rarely express as clean forward escalation (Impetus).
