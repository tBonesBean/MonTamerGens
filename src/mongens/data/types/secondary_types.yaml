secondary_types:
    # IMPETUS
    Surge:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        notes: Sudden acceleration; burst application of force

    Shear:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        notes: Force applied across boundaries; tearing or splitting effects

    Pulse:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        notes: Rhythmic emission of force; repetition over magnitude

    Drive:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        notes: Sustained forward pressure; momentum that compounds over time

    # VEIL
    Ward:
        cluster: VEIL
        notes: Structured interference; imposed rules on interaction

    Refraction:
        cluster: VEIL
        notes: Redirection of effects without absorption

    Imposter:
        cluster: VEIL
        notes: False signal; misattribution of source or target

    Veil:
        cluster: VEIL
        notes: Obscuration of state, intent, or presence

    # HOLDFAST
    Inert:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        notes: Resistance through non-response; dampening of effects

    Anchor:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        notes: Positional inertia; refusal to be displaced

    Bulwark:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        notes: Layered endurance; structured defense

    Tenacity:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        notes: Persistence under attrition; refusal to collapse
