    Surge:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        label: 'Burst / Acceleration'
        question: 'What erupts without warning?'

                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Surge compounds naturally with forward pressure (Impetus), can be refracted
                into surprising directions (Veil), but is blunted by persistent resistance
                (Holdfast).

    Shear:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        label: 'Splitting / Boundary Force'
        question: 'Where does this cut across?'
        tagline: 'Force across boundaries; tearing effects'
        notes: Force applied across boundaries; tearing or splitting effects

                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Shear amplifies through continued force application (Impetus), can grind against
                resistance to widen cracks (Holdfast), but is poorly served by misdirection --
                it needs a clear plane of action (Veil).

    Pulse:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        label: 'Rhythm / Repetition'
        question: 'What keeps hitting?'
        tagline: 'Rhythmic emission of force; repetition over magnitude'
        notes: Rhythmic emission of force; repetition over magnitude
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [IMPETUS]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Pulse gains strength through compounding rhythm (Impetus), can be layered with
                interference patterns (Veil), but is dampened by inertia that absorbs each
                beat (Holdfast).

    Drive:
        cluster: IMPETUS
        label: 'Sustained Pressure / Compounding'
        question: 'What refuses to stop pushing?'
        tagline: 'Sustained forward pressure; compounding momentum'
        notes: Sustained forward pressure; momentum that compounds over time
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [IMPETUS]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Drive expresses through relentless escalation (Impetus), can wear down even
                persistent defenses over time (Holdfast), but is poorly served by distortion
                that breaks its line of advance (Veil).

    # VEIL
    Ward:
        cluster: VEIL
        label: 'Structured Interference / Imposed Rules'
        question: 'What rules are being imposed on this interaction?'
        tagline: 'Structured interference; imposed interaction rules'
        notes: Structured interference; imposed rules on interaction
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:

                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Ward layers naturally with other forms of interference (Veil), can reinforce
                defensive structures (Holdfast), but is overwhelmed by blunt escalation that
                ignores imposed rules (Impetus).

    Refraction:
        cluster: VEIL
        label: 'Redirection / Deflection'
        question: 'Where does this send the force instead?'
        tagline: 'Redirection of effects without absorption'
        notes: Redirection of effects without absorption
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:

                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [HOLDFAST]
            notes: >
                Refraction compounds with other distortion layers (Veil), can redirect momentum
                to useful ends (Impetus), but cannot function when locked into rigid fixed
                positions (Holdfast).

    Imposter:
        cluster: VEIL
        label: 'False Signal / Misattribution'
        question: 'What is pretending to be something else?'
        tagline: 'False signal; misattribution of source or target'
        notes: False signal; misattribution of source or target
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Imposter thrives in layered deception (Veil), can masquerade as stability
                (Holdfast), but is exposed by direct force that demands authentic response
                (Impetus).

    Veil:
        cluster: VEIL
        label: 'Obscuration / Concealment'
        question: 'What is being hidden?'
        tagline: 'Obscuration of state, intent, or presence'
        notes: Obscuration of state, intent, or presence
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [VEIL]
                neutral: [HOLDFAST]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Veil deepens with additional interference layers (Veil), can passively persist
                behind defensive states (Holdfast), but is stripped away by sustained pressure
                (Impetus).

    # HOLDFAST
    Inert:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        label: 'Non-Response / Dampening'
        question: 'What refuses to react?'
        tagline: 'Resistance through non-response; dampening'
        notes: Resistance through non-response; dampening of effects
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Inert compounds with other forms of persistence (Holdfast), can passively
                support obscuration (Veil), but is least effective against escalation that
                eventually forces a response (Impetus).

    Anchor:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        label: 'Positional Inertia / Immovability'
        question: 'What will not be moved?'
        tagline: 'Positional inertia; refusal of displacement'
        notes: Positional inertia; refusal to be displaced
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Anchor endures through layered resistance (Holdfast), can absorb and halt
                momentum through mass (Impetus), but is poorly served by misdirection that
                demands repositioning (Veil).

    Bulwark:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        label: 'Layered Endurance / Structured Defense'
        question: 'How many layers must be broken?'
        tagline: 'Layered endurance; structured defense'
        notes: Layered endurance; structured defense
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [VEIL]
                strained: [IMPETUS]
            notes: >
                Bulwark stacks with other defensive states (Holdfast), can incorporate
                interference into its layering (Veil), but is degraded by sustained escalation
                that strips layers faster than they rebuild (Impetus).

    Tenacity:
        cluster: HOLDFAST
        label: 'Persistence / Attrition Resistance'
        question: 'What outlasts everything else?'
        tagline: 'Persistence under attrition; refusal to collapse'
        notes: Persistence under attrition; refusal to collapse
        affinity:
            secondary_clusters:
                favored: [HOLDFAST]
                neutral: [IMPETUS]
                strained: [VEIL]
            notes: >
                Tenacity endures through raw persistence (Holdfast), can slowly grind against
                incoming force (Impetus), but is least natural when forced to misdirect or
                obscure -- it simply refuses to fall (Veil).
