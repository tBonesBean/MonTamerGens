    IMPETUS:
        label: 'Force / Momentum'
        question: 'How does pressure propagate?'
        tagline: 'Applied force, escalation, inherited motion'
        description: >
            Applied force and forward momentum.
            Effects that escalate, propagate, or inherit motion once begun.

            - damage amplification

                Impetus expresses most naturally through kinetic identity (Dynamic), can pressure
                unrealized states into action (Potential), but struggles against rigid bounds
                (Structural) and inertial weight (Residual).

    VEIL:
        label: 'Interference / Distortion'
        question: 'What is being obscured or redirected?'
        tagline: 'Distortion, redirection, information control'
        description: >
            Interference without destruction.
            Effects that obscure, redirect, or distort interaction outcomes.
        design_bias:
            - redirection
            - suppression
            - information distortion
        affinity:
            primary_clusters:
                favored: [POTENTIAL]
                neutral: [STRUCTURAL, DYNAMIC]
                strained: [RESIDUAL]
            notes: >
                Veil thrives alongside unrealized possibility (Potential), can bend both
                structure and motion (Structural, Dynamic), but is least effective against
                residue that simply persists regardless (Residual).

    HOLDFAST:
        label: 'Resistance / Persistence'
        question: 'What refuses to move?'
        tagline: 'Inertia, endurance, refusal of displacement'
        description: >
            Local resistance and inertial persistence.
            Effects that mitigate, endure, or refuse displacement.
        design_bias:
            - damage mitigation
            - integrity preservation
            - defensive states
        affinity:
            primary_clusters:
                favored: [STRUCTURAL, RESIDUAL]
                neutral: [POTENTIAL]
                strained: [DYNAMIC]
            notes: >
                Holdfast sustains most naturally alongside rigid identity (Structural) and
                persistent aftermath (Residual), can contain unrealized potential (Potential),
                but chafes against motion that demands change (Dynamic).
