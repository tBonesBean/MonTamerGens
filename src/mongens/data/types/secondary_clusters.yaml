    IMPETUS:
        description: >
            Applied force and forward momentum.
            Effects that escalate, propagate, or inherit motion once begun.
        design_bias:
            - damage amplification
            - tempo pressure
            - combo inheritance

    VEIL:
        description: >
            Interference without destruction.
            Effects that obscure, redirect, or distort interaction outcomes.
        design_bias:
            - redirection
            - suppression
            - information distortion

    HOLDFAST:
        description: >
            Local resistance and inertial persistence.
            Effects that mitigate, endure, or refuse displacement.
        design_bias:
            - damage mitigation
            - integrity preservation
            - defensive states
