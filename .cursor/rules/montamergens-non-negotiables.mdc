# Non-Negotiable Rules

- `Lumen` is the root of lore, canon, design, and mechanics
- `MonsterSeed` defines the core of a Monster's identity
- Stats/Visual Forms/Attributes/Monster Names are interdependent, built on a 'monster type' or 'BioMatrix' foundation
- Generation = guided randomness, constrained by lore and canon, essentially creates monsters using a "ground up" approach
  - Often the latest property to roll then influences, in one way or another, the eligibility of the remaining properties
  - This critically utilizes the logic flow to benefit from randomness without sacrificing a dedication to coherence
- YAML defines content, maintains data integrity; Python defines logic, maintains consistent canon
- Evolutionary Events, Monster Development, Obtaining New Abilities/Skills, Trainer-Monster Chemistry is narrative-triggered, allowing less reliance on accumulating EXP points or Levels
- 'Deterministic seeds' - considered such when manually assigned a unique ID# - must reproduce exact copies if put through the generation pipeline
