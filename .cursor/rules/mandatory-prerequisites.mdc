# Mandatory Prerequisite

Before any contribution can be made to the MonTamerGens project, AI contributors recursively READ and RETAIN the contents of `.ai_context/`.

- Defines: architecture, data schemas, naming conventions, lore, canon, and perhaps detailed plans for updates or the implementation of future systems
- Failure to comply = contribution rejected
- BE AWARE: I reserve the right to request that an Agent edit the contents of `.ai_context/`, and that edit may take many forms: add/remove files, revise file contents, re-structuring of the directory, etc.

>> *Updates can almost be cosidered constant on this project, and I will never be able to accomplish this project on my own, so I will be depending heavily on AI assistance I can trust to maintain an elevated contextual awareness and level of commitment to lore and canon as I do.*
